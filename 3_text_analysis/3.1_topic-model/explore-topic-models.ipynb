    "## Some sample LDA topic model visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook contains a number of **visualizations** that might aid the researcher to evaluate and analyse a topic model. Note that this is in all respect still **work-in-progress**. The evaluation of a topic model is a challange, and must be made by a human, but there are some methods and computed metrics that can be used to give hints to the researcher. The goal is to find and test some of those metrics. Another goal is of course to give the researcher **means to simply browse and explore** the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Några syften (inte specifikt för denna sida eller Jupyter):\n",
    "- Stöd för att testa olika parametersättningar\n",
    "- Finns visualiseringar hjälper till att evaluera modell\n",
    "- Testa metriker som kan indikera konstigheter\n",
    "- Stöd för att uforska modellen och topics\n",
    "- Tillgängligöra metoder\n",
    "- Transparans av data och flöde (del av Open Science)\n",
    "- Stöd för forskare som saknar programmeringskunskaper\n",
    "- Skjuta beslut och tolkning bort från teknikern till forskaren\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of other tools and applications, both online and downloadable packages, that can be used for visualizing various perspectives of topic models. Some of these are Termite (Stanford), TensorBoard (Google), Hiérarchie, Word Embedding Visual Explorer [Online](http://residue3.sci.utah.edu/?) [wevi: word embedding visual inspector [source](https://ronxin.github.io/wevi/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738), LAMVI, Sentiview, Lexos and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling can be used for common NLP tasks such as language detection, language translation, sentiment analysis, PoS-tagging, dependency analysis. Its primary usage is perhaps document ranking and classification, and document querying. Another interesting use case is recommendation systems (such as Spotify uses, and as described in [link](http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=136352) and [link](https://github.com/mattdennewitz/playlist-to-vec).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a pipeline - more a way to share ideas and work between different projects that have similar technical needs. Humlab has a \"textanalytic team\" that meets once a month where researchers from various projects participate.\n",

    "On the projects web sites at [http://jupyter.org/] it is stated that\n",
    ">“Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open standards, and services for **interactive and reproducible computing**”.<br/><br/>\n",
    ">“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.” <br/><br/>\n",

    "Data science is a big “buzzword” - outside academia est. 1.5 million positions in US alone. Data science lies in the intersection between several advanced fields, and it is costly to acquire and keep these skills. Lots of necessary skills and knowledge are built-in to ready-to use (sort of) software libraries, though, but it is a  risky to use these kind of libraries entiraly as black-boxes.\n",

    "#### Jupyter Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a **web application** that can either be run on a local computer, or hosted in a multi-user environment. The main advantage of the latter is that the end user only need a web browser to open and execute a notebook. When used locally, the user must install Python and Jupyter, as well as all the necessary frameworks that are needed for the project (and also the correct version of each framework). Server hosted installations is therefore much preferably in most cases.\n",

    "#### Why use Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to learn, use and deploy, lots of people know Python.\n",
    "- Ready to use online platform - trivial to create simple interactivity.\n",
    "- Much faster (and cheaper) development - immediate feedback - agile, collaborative.\n",
    "- Can defer decisions from developer to researcher. \n",
    "- The ability to combine data, narrative and code into an interactive user interface.\n",
    "- Fits users with different tech skills, some researcher wants to understand and be able to tune the logic.\n",
    "- Supports Python, that has big ecosystem of (open source) software libraries.\n",
    "- Very popular, millons of notebooks exist on GitHub."

    "\n",
    "The figure below shows some of the methods, frameworks and tools used in this topic modelling workflow. The so called *technology stack* spans a large variety of domains and fields, where each single method or technology can have a rather steep learning curve. There are also many similar frameworks to choose from, many with overlapping or similar functionality. Each functionality in turn has a number of elements that need to be configured for proper use. This require both specific knowledge, and usage experience in order to safely apply the methods and tools on the problem at hand. What's missing in the figure, which is important to note, is the *problem domain specific knowledge* that is required to interpret and validate the result of the topic models.\n",

    "This method and tool chain unavoidably requires a multitude of both major and minor decisions. It can even be difficult to determine which decision is minor or major. To some extent, black-box use is unavoidable, but this emphasizes the need of a proper validation process. The Jupyter Notebook helps transferring some of these decisions from the tech specialist to the end user i.e. the researcher. It is of great advantage - and a signum of the Python ecosystem - that so many proven and battle-tested open source frameworks and tools exists."

    "Please see [add link] for an introduction on what Jupyter notebooksare and how to use them. In short, a notebook is a document with embedded executable code presented in a simple and easy to use web interface. Most important things to note are:\n",
    "- Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface.\n",
    "- The **code cells** contains the script code (Python in this case, but can be other languages are also suported) and are the sections marked by **In [x]** in the left margin. It is marked as **In []** if it hasn't been executed, and as **In [n]** when it has been executed(n is an integer). A cell marked as **In [\\*]** is either executing, or waiting to be executed (i.e. other cells are executing).\n",
    "- The **current cell** is highlighted with a blue (or green if in \"edit\" mode) border. You make a cell current by clicking on it,\n",
    "- Code cells aren't executed automatically. Instead you execute the current cell by either pressing **shift+enter** or the **play** button in the toolbar. The output (or result) of a cell's execution is presented directly below the cell prefixed by **Out[n]**.\n",
    "- The next cell will automatically be selected (made current) after a cell has been executed. Repeatadly pressing **shift+enter** or the play button hence executes the cells in sequence.\n",
    "- You can run the entire notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. Note that this can take some time to finish. You can see how cells are executed in sequence via the indicator in the margin (i.e. \"In [\\*]\" changes to \"In [n]\" where n is an integer).\n",
    "- The cells can be edited if they are double-clicked, in which case the cell border turns green. Use the ESC key to escape edit mode (or click on any other cell).\n",
