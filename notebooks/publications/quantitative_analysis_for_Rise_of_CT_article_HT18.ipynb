    "### The Rise of the Cultural Treaty (article draft, Fall 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Cultural treaties are the bi-lateral and multilateral agreements among states that promote and regulate cooperation and exchange in the fields of life generally call cultural or intellectual. Although it was only invented in the early twentieth century, this treaty type came to be the fourth most common bilateral treaty in the period 1900-1980 (Poast et al., 2010). In this project (funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences), we seek to use the world's cultural treaties as a historical source with which to explore the emergence of a global concept of culture in the twentieth century. Specifically, the project will investigate the hypothesis that the culture concept, in contrast to earlier ideas of civilization, played a key role in the consolidation of the post-World War II international order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central questions that this project explores can be divided into two groups: \n",
    "- First, what is the story of the cultural treaty, as a specific tool of international relations, in the twentieth century? What was the historical curve of cultural treaty-making? For example, in which political or ideological constellations do we find (the most) use of cultural treaties? Among which countries, in which historical periods? What networks of relations were thereby created, reinforced, or challenged? \n",
    "- Second, what is the \"culture\" addressed in these treaties? That is, what do the two signatories seem to mean by \"culture\" in these documents, and what does that tell us about the role that concept played in the international system? How can quantitative work on this dataset advance research questions about the history of concepts?\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin here with the first set of questions. It seems worthwhile to begin by getting an historical overview of the emergence and use of this treaty-type. (I have been inspired in this approach by Keene 2012.) This article thus offers a quantiative overview of the rise of the cultural treaty, as a new type of bilateral agreement, in the twentieth century. It outlines the statistical trends that can be observed, and examines and analyzes several of these. The basis of this study is a quantitative analysis of the metadata about all bilateral cultural treaties signed betweeen 1919 and 1972. The data for this investigation comes from the [World Treaty Index](http://worldtreatyindex.com/) (Poast 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "A first question I address in the article has to do with the definition of a \"cultural treaty.\" Here, we use the coding of the WTI. This, I have confirmed, corresponds closely to the categories developed by United Nations officials (see UNESCO 1962). The issue of the definition of this treaty type was the subject of debate in the interwar period. I address that debate in a separate, future article (Martin, \"The Birth of the Cultural Treaty in Europe's Age of Crisis\", under review).  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the definitional question settled, let us turn to the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some set-up sections, the discussion of the material begins at \"Part 1,\" below."

    "This chart shows the number of new treaties signed per year in each of the sub-categories classified un the WTI as \"cultural\" (that is, under the heading 7Culture). This category, like the others used in the WTI, corresponds closely to those used by the United Nations and its institutions. “The term bilateral general cultural agreements,” according to a 1962 UNESCO publication, “is used to denote cultural conventions between two States or governments, dealing with all or several aspects of international relations in the field of education, science and culture” (UNESCO 1962, 65). Somewhat confusingly, this grouping includes one sub-category called 7CULT. This category covers both \"general cultural agreements\" as well as \"specialized agreements\" addressing such things as \"cultural institutes; artistic exhibitions; protection of literary and artistic property,” regulating exchanges among the class of persons that includes \"Artists (general); writers; musicians (composers, conductors, singers and instrumentalists); painters and sculptors; actors; film actors; dancers; artistes; architects; librarians; museum archivists; archaeologists\" (UNESCO 1962, 18).\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to explore the use of the cultural treaty is to compare it to the frequency of use of other treaty types. One might suspect, for example, that the growth in the use of cultural treaties simply reflected an increase in the number of states, in particular the emergence of many new postcolonial states around 1960. Chart 5 tests this suspicion by comparing the number of new cultural treaties to a the treaties of group of agreements typically signed with new states: these are the \"diplomatic\" agreements (WTI category 1), a category that includes treaties establishing diplomatic relations as well as peace treaties, treaties of friendship and mutual assistance, and territorial and reparations settlements. We see that the burst of new treaties of recognition following World War II was not accompanied by any major growth in the use of cultural treaties. After that, CT-making echoed increases in diplomatic treaty making. For example, the peak of cultural treaty-making in 1961, followed by a steep decline in 1962, clearly echoed, with a short delay, the burst of diplomatic agreements that took place in 1960, followed by a steep dropoff in 1961. From 1966-1969, however, cultural treaty-making outpaced the signing of new diplomatic agreements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After WWII, then, the cultural treaty existed already, but diplomats chose only rarely to use it in the first postwar decade, although there were many new states and, one might think, a lot of relationships in need of being reestablished. Something seems to have happened beginning in 1957--something beyond the mere apperance of new states, that is--that made the cultural treaty seem newly attractive and relevant to diplomats.\n"

The default time period division is 1919-1944, 1945-1955, 1956-1966, and 1967-1972, the alternative division has 1940-1944 as an additional period. The third division is a single period between 1945 and 1972 (inclusive)\n",

Some predefined party sets exist in the \"Preset\" dropdown, and, when selected, the corresponding parties is selected in the \"Parties\" widget. Use the \"Top #n\" slider to display parties with most treaties for each period. Note that a value greater than 0 will disable the \"Parties\" widget since these to selections are mutually exclusive. Set slider back to 0 to enable the \"Parties\" widget.\n",
    "\n",

Note again, that both these counts are restricted by time period (no treaty outside period), and selected topic filter.\n",
